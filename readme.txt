# API Framework: YAML (Single Data Provider for Diff APIs)

git clone https://github.com/sheetalrepo/ApiTestFW.git

1. Framework support GET/POST request.
2. All the test data for different type of APIs are kept under common Yaml file (src\test\resources\testdata)
3. For every test cases, we have single Data Provider which is of great importance
4. Test Data is kept in a YAML file rather json, excel, csv etc. Yaml gives huge advantages over other format in terms of readability, code minimization, maintenance
5. This framework can be run according to different suits like smoke, reg. Suites has been implemented based on test data provided.
   For example; for sanity testing few test data requires and for reg phase huge data require

## Advantages ##
1. Its a properly layered framework means every layer has its own functionalities 

	#Data Layer (src/test/java/com/data)
		a. Data layer will read yaml, convert it into AllTestCaseData.java (src/test/java/com/data/yaml)
		b. AllTestCaseData contains a Map which contains all data present in yaml file
		c. Map is based on test cases name and their respective data
		d. At runtime Data Provider will provider only specific data to @Test method which is required
		e. Data Provider will filter the test data based on test category provided in test data e.g. sanity, reg etc
		   test category defined in properties.yaml file (cases_to_be_run)
	
	#Business Layer (src/test/java/com/businesslayer)
		a. Sole purpose is to perform business logic tasks
		b. Methods expects some data and populate response POJOs (src/test/java/com/pojos)
		
	#Test Case Layer (src/test/java/testcases)
		a. Will get data from Data Provider, Call Business Layer for operation and perform Assertions
	

2. Data is getting picked from YAML rather excel. Make sure data is kept either in JSON, YAML or CSV but never in excel
3. Logger has been implemented and logs can be taken from /target/output.log



#TODOs
1. single data provider for all the data  - done
2. running from TestNG.xml and using testCategory values - done
3. POST request implementation - done
